// A. Q + A

//1. An assignment opperator ( Let,const,var = (your variable) )

//2. we can change variables in multiple ways using conditionals, arithmetic operators, and methods or simply writing a new variable 

//3. we can assign it similarly how we used assignment operators ex: (let newVar = oldVar)

//4. declare = to make the computer aware of a new variable being assigned 
//   assign = to give the variable a key word to call upon that variable later
//   define = define the data type that is being coded (function,object,variable etc)

//5. psuedocoding is processing the logic the computer needs to reach an end goal without actually coding. We use this to give us
// a blueprint of what needs to coded to reach our goal

//6. I believe its different for every problem, simple problems should be quick and can be done in your head, vs longer problems need
// more time to be planned out and define steps for each part of a problem


//B. Strings


//1.
// let firstVariable 

//2. 
// let firstVariable = 'Hello World'

//3.
// let firstVariable = 3

//4. 
// let secondVariable(3) = firstVariable(3)

//5. 
// let secondVariable = "Any String"

//6.
//let second variable(any string) = first Variable ()
// the value of first variable is  3  since firstVariable is = SecondVariable

//7.
// let yourName = "Lucas"
// let message = 'Hello, my name is ' + yourName


// C. BOOLEANS


//1. <
//2. >
//3. ==
//4. ||
//5. && x 4 || (at the end)
//6. &&
//7. ===
//8. < , &&
//9. == , !==
//10. ==


//D The farm


//1. animal = "cow"

//2. if (animal === "cow"){
//    console.log("mooooo")
//}

//3. 

// let animal = "chicken"
// if (animal === "cow"){
//     console.log("mooooo")
// } else {
//     console.log("Hey! your not a cow")
// }

//4.
